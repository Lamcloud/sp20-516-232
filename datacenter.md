## 1: Define carbon footprint of data centers
##### Carbon footprint of a data center is *Carbon dioxide emission coefficient of a Data Center*

## 2: Clonee Data Center
### Overview
Facebook broke ground on the Clonee data centre in 2016 and the first building became operational in December 2017. The centre is built on a 250-acre site. Brookfield Renewable supplying 100% renewable wind energy to this Data Center.

 **US average carbon foot print**: 16.49 metric tons

## 4: Recyclers  
Recycling is linked with renewable energy as it helps in replenishing the natural resources of the earth. A growing number of data centers are redirecting the heat from their hot aisles to nearby homes, offices, greenhouses and even swimming pools. The ability to re-use excess heat from servers is being built into new data centers, helping to improve the energy efficiency profile of these facilities.  

some interesting examples of heat recycling are:

**Telecity (France)**:

Telecity is using waste heat from its Condorcet data center in Paris to heat an on-site Climate Change Arboretum

**IBM (Switzerland)**:
An IBM data center in Switzerland is being used to heat a nearby swimming pool. 

**IBM and Syracuse University (New York)**:
A data center built by IBM and Syracuse University uses gas-powered micro-turbines to generate on-site power. During the winter, the 585 degree F (307 C) exhaust from the micro-turbines flows through heat exchangers to produce hot water, which is then piped to a nearby office building to be reused in the building’s heating system.

**Notre Dame University (Indiana)**:
The Notre Dame Center for Research Computing has placed a rack of high-performance computing (HPC) nodes at a local municipal greenhouse, the South Bend Greenhouse and Botanical Garden, to help heat the flowers and plants in the facility.

**Facebook Cloud campus in Odense, Denmark**: 
Facebook expects the Odense system will warm 6,900 homes by data center servers in Stockholm and other European cities that employ district heating.
